# Nuarcasql

This project was created as part of the interview process at Nuarca

It consists in a frontend that pulls the information from a mySQL server database using a Express REST API.

Inside the `server` folder there's a script to build the schema and the sample express application.
To make it easier, this has been deployed to Heroku on the [https://nuarca-test.herokuapp.com/](https://nuarca-test.herokuapp.com/) endpoint. Just perform a `GET` request and all the contents of the database will be obtained in JSON format.

To test the angular app use ng serve or npm start on the development folder (make sure to use npm install first to load all dependencies) or use the content on the dist folder.
